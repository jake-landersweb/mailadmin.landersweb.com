# Mail Admin Repo

This is a repo to hold the website for the mailer.landersweb.com source code. This gives a simple dashboard showing the status of the emailer, along with an advanced sorting and filtering system. You can also view a preview of the html email sent, and choose to delete the email if you see fit.

This is intended for mailer admins, because all sensitive information about the emails are shown.

It is simple right now, but powerful in seeing what messages are being sent by the mailer.

## Tech

This is built using NextJS 13, which is currently in beta. Uses tailwind for styling, and react-icons for icons.
